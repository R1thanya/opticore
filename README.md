## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptiCore.git
````

2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the website locally.

3. Modify `style.css` to adjust colors, fonts, or layout as needed.

## Notes

* The contact form currently only resets and shows an alert upon submission. To handle actual messages, integrate a backend service like Formspree, EmailJS, or your own server.
* Bootstrap is included via CDN for simplicity, so no local installation is required.
